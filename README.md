### Here are the steps to view and interact with the mutation network:

  1. Open the HTML file in any web browser.

  2. Upload the CSV file to the website.

  3. Use the source node dropdown menu to select a node. This will update the visualization to show the mutation network for that node, with all other nodes.

  4. Each node in the mutation network will be connected to the selected node with an edge, except for itself.

  5. Hovering over a node will display a tooltip that shows information about the node and the mutations between the nodes.

  6. Hovering over an edge will also display the mutations between the nodes.

  7. Use the target node dropdown menu to select a target node. This will highlight both the selected source node and the target node, and show the edge between the two nodes with a tooltip.
