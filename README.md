### Here are the steps to view and interact with the mutation network:

  1. Open the HTML file in any web browser.

  2. Upload the CSV file to the website.

  3. Use the source node dropdown menu to select a node. This will update the visualization to show the mutation network for that specific node. If you want to see the mutations of all nodes, select "All Nodes" from the dropdown menu.

  4. When hovering over a node, a tooltip will appear displaying information about the node and the dictionary of all mutations compared to this node.

  5. Hovering over an edge will also display the corresponding sequence index between the nodes.
